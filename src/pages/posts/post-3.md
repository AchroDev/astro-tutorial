## What I've accomplished:

1. The Header and Footer are now part of the Markdown Layout astro component.
2. Completed about 60% of the Blog Tutorial Project from the Astro Docs.
3. Successfully set the site up to be live on netlify and update when the GitHub repository updates.
4. Created multiple custom components to use across the site.

## What's Next:

Next up is working on learning about using glob imports with the `import.meta.glob()` to create an RSS feed for all blog posts.
