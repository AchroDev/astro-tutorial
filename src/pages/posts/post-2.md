## What I've Accomplished:

1. After a successful first night learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component for `Social` links and site `Navigation`!

## What's Next:

Next up is going to be creating a custom `Header` and `Footer` component for the site navigation and social links.
