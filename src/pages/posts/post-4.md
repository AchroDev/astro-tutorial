## What I've Accomplished:

1. Now using `import.meta.glob()` to return a list of all my posts and added RSS xml config.
2. Added a `Tags` page to correctly list and organize posts by their respective tag.
3. Created specific layout components. One as a base for all pages, and the other specific to blog posts.
4. Added __light/dark__ mode switcher.
5. Custom `Greeting` on site `Home` page.
6. Finished the Tutorial!

## What's Next:

There is an optional path for `Make a content collection` and I'm going to do it. See you there!
